A Rails demo showing parameters handling and passing data to a view

## Running The Example

First start the server:

```
./script/server
```

Then set your browser to: http://localhost:3000/pages/home

## Filtering
To pass a parameter value and see the filtering logic in action use a query parameter: http://localhost:3000/pages/home?q=bi

## Code

All code found in `lib` will automatically be loaded and available for you by rails. In this example it's `lib/magic_hat.rb`

Controller code is in the file `app/controllers/pages.rb`
